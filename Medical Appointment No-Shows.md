# Medical Appointment No-Shows: A Data-Driven Approach

## üìù Project Summary

This project aims to provide an in-depth analysis of patient appointment no-shows in Brazil. Using various data science techniques, we explore the key factors contributing to this issue and build a machine learning model to predict which patients are likely to miss their appointments.

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization

Our analysis revealed several key findings, which are visually represented in a comprehensive dashboard.

### Key Findings:
* **Overall No-show Rate:** Approximately **20.19%** of patients did not show up for their appointments.
* **Gender Impact:** There is a slight difference in no-show rates between males and females, with both hovering around **20%**.
* **Age Impact:** The highest no-show rates were observed in the age groups of 19-30 and 31-45 years.
* **Long Wait Times:** The most significant finding was the impact of appointment wait times. Patients who waited **30 days or more** had a no-show rate more than double that of those who waited less (**~45%** vs. **~20%**). This suggests long wait times are a major factor.

## ü§ñ Modeling and Prediction

We used a **Logistic Regression** model to predict patient no-shows. The initial model performed poorly due to **imbalanced data** (a large number of patients who showed up versus a small number of no-shows). To address this, we used the **SMOTE** technique.

### Model Performance Improvement:
* **Initial Model:** The model's ability to correctly identify no-shows (`recall`) was only **8%**.
* **Improved Model (with SMOTE):** The `recall` for no-shows significantly improved to **52%**, demonstrating the effectiveness of the SMOTE technique in handling imbalanced data.

## üí° Recommendations

Based on our analysis and predictive modeling, we propose the following recommendations:
1.  **Improve Reminder System:** Instead of sending an SMS reminder just one day before the appointment, consider sending it two days prior or making a personal phone call.
2.  **Reduce Wait Times:** Given the strong correlation between long wait times and no-shows, a key strategy is to reduce appointment scheduling delays.
